![My Image](public/hermes-logo.jpeg)

# Summary
- This is the front-end React application for Hermes, a simple chat app designed to provide users with an intuitive messaging experience. Built using React.js, the app focuses on delivering real-time communication with a clean and responsive user interface. The front-end interacts with a back-end API to manage user messages, chat rooms, and user authentication, ensuring seamless communication. With a focus on performance and user-friendly design, this project demonstrates a modern approach to building interactive web applications.

# Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
First, you'll need to clone the Git repository that contains your React project. Open your terminal and run:

**Copy**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your repository (for example, https://github.com/username/repo.git).
```
After cloning, navigate into the project directory:

**Copy**
```bash
cd <project-directory>
Replace <project-directory> with the actual folder name of your project.
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
React projects usually have dependencies listed in a package.json file. To install them, you'll need to use npm or yarn (depending on what package manager the project uses).

If the project uses npm:

**Copy**
```bash
npm install
If the project uses yarn:
```

3. **Run the development server:**
- After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server to run your React application.

**Copy**
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
- create a .env file in the root of your project directory, and add the necessary variables.
